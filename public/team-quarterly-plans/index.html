When we set OKR's for a product team it's often hard for the entire organisation to understand why we are focusing on one area and not another.</p> <p>I do a lot of stakeholder management, leadership meetings and tour our offices every quarter to do product all-hands. I talk a lot about why we focus on the areas we do. But again and again, we started to get questions later in the quarter "why this, and not that?".</p> <p>I have also been struggling with the responsibility of setting the OKR's, is that with the me as a manager or the product team?</p> <p>We have combined that answer to these two problems into one solution, the Team Quarterly Plan.</p> <p><img alt="" class=img-fluid src="/images/tqp-2dcf3f43.png"/></p> <h2 id=scope>Scope</h2> <p>In the past I have asked teams to achieve an OKR defined by me, it was often a bit of a conflict as the team thought something else was more important but they had a hard time discussing it with me as I (and the rest of the management team) had a more holistic knowledge of the company's business issues but also lacked the deep product knowledge that the product teams have.</p> <p>I hated dictating a direction and was often unsure if we were right as our product and customer knowledge is a lot lower then the product managers.</p> <p>We are now changing away from dictating an OKR to setting a scope.</p> <p>The scope is very simple, I use my knowledge about what's holistically most important for Trustpilot within the context of the team and ask the team to look into that area. An example could be:</p> <p>"We need a more productive sales force".</p> <p>If you give that scope to the team that is responsible for driving upgrades from our Free product to a paid product they know much more about how to set OKR's than I do as a VP.</p> <h2 id=team-quarterly-plan>Team Quarterly Plan</h2> <p>With a given scope the team goes back and starts to look into the scope and use all their knowledge about the product and it's customers to develop an OKR that makes sense.</p> <p>When you choose an OKR you need to choose something that has a significant impact on your company. A product team at Trustpilot is roughly 6 people, the OKR defines what they are trying to achieve in the next 3 months. This adds up to 1.5 man years of work where success is defined by the OKR. If the impact from the OKR is very small, the ROI for sure turns negative.</p> <p>The team documents the expected impact and ROI together with the OKR in what we call a Team Quarterly Plan. The plan should give the answer to why we are focusing on this area. Its written in a way so everybody around the company can read the plan and be convinced that the team is working on an impactful thing.</p> <p>The Team Quarterly Plan is not a business plan, but much more a back of the envelope calculation and formulation of the impact of achieving the OKR we set up to achieve.</p> <h2 id=but-what-are-you-going-to-do>But what are you going to do?</h2> <p>In the plan, we also add a section where we describe what we right now know we are going to test and deliver to achieve the OKR in the upcoming quarter. This is not a roadmap, not a promise of what's to come, it's solely a description of what kind of things we expect that's needed to achieve our goal. It's also only a captured state of what we knew when we wrote the plan, it is not updated during the quarter.</p> <h2 id=the-finished-plan>The finished plan</h2> <p>The finished plan should cover the following::</p> <ul> <li>Business why, the business impact on Trustpilot as a business including data</li> <li>The goal: objective and key results</li> <li>Discovery, what ideas do we have that can help us achieve our goals, describe each idea.</li> <li>Delivery: What delivery do we already know is needed in the quarter?</li> </ul> <p>Donâ€™t write a long plan, the why should be maximum two pages long, and the goal in form of an OKR is always short. The discovery and delivery parts should be as short and easy to read as possible, would be great to illustrate it if you already have mockups are drawings. Remember to tell people that the content in these sections are ideas for directions, not final decisions.</p> <h2 id=the-decision-is-with-the-product-manager>The decision is with the product manager</h2> <p>By implementing this we move the decision of focus and responsibility for a good strong "why" from the VP team to the individual product manager. If the product manager comes back and tells us that he can't do a valuable goal within the scope we gave him, we are obligated to change to scope.</p> <p>This moves the power and knowledge of prioritisation from leadership to the product manager. He is now empowered to stand by his goals and lead a team to success.</p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class=""> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 "> <div class=""> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl mt-0"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class=mt-8> <form onsubmit="fathom.trackEvent('Newsletter Signup');" class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 mt-8 lg:mt-10"> <div class=""> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-500"> &copy; 2025 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ogkit@1"></script> </body> </html>
