Often in our talks, their dream process and workplace is quite close to how we work at Trustpilot. Our conversations are often short and not really in depth so I leave them with a list of books and blogs to read, my full list is long, but below is a list of four books that are must read for all product managers and everybody working in a product organization.</p> <p>I would love to hear what books I should read next! Shoot me a tweet at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/nikstep">@nikstep</a>.</p> <h2 id=inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love>Inspired: How To Create Products Customers Love</h2> <p>by Marty Cagen</p> <p>This is the bible. Marty Cagan is a product veteran, former VP Product at eBay, AOL and Netscape today he is running Silicon Valley Product Group where he teaches tech companies like Google, Facebook, Etsy, PayPal and of course Trustpilot how to run product and ensure that we create products that our customers love.</p> <p>Marty’s great book is a bit of a heavy read but contains only gold. He is also right now working on a second edition that will be out this winter, you can already <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inspired-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/">preorder it here</a>.</p> <p>You should also read <a href="https://svpg.com/articles/">SVPG’s blog</a> and subscribe to their newsletter, another goldmine for us product managers and leaders.</p> <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired">Find the book on Goodreads</a>.</p> <h2 id=the-lean-startup-how-constant-innovation-creates-radically-successful-businesses>The Lean Startup: How Constant Innovation Creates Radically Successful Businesses</h2> <p>by Eric Ries</p> <p>More of a general startup book, many of the principles in discovery is described on Erics Build, measure learn loop described in the book.

This book was the first book I read about building a software business back in 2010. The book itself is from 2006 and they have later written er newer version called <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/rework">Rework</a>. I think the original self and free book is still the best.</p> <p>The book contains 91 short essays about building a SaaS company. Everything from getting started to hiring, coding and prioritizing. The book will not give you a deep dive into every topic, but a general kick in the balls that will make you think about how you build a company that you what to still be working in 40 years from now.</p> <p>The team behind Basecamp (former 37signals) also publish an <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/">amazing blog</a> that I still read every week.</p> <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/447648.Getting_Real">Find the book on Goodreads</a> and <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real">read it for free here</a>.</p> <h2 id=radical-focus-achieving-your-most-important-goals-with-objectives-and-key-results>Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results</h2> <p>by Christina Wodtke</p> <p>Setting goals and following up on them is one of the most important parts of product management. The best toolset to do this that I have met is called OKR’s, short for Objectives and Key Results. Invented by Intel and made popular by John Doerr OKR’s are used to set goals and track them in companies of all sizes from Google to a small startup.</p> <p>The book is a good lightweight introduction to OKR’s. If you or your organization is not yet using OKR’s, this is now your highest priority to implement, stop reading this blog and go and read Radical Focus.</p> <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28951428-radical-focus">Find the book on Goodreads</a></p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class=""> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 "> <div class=""> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl mt-0"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class=mt-8> <form onsubmit="fathom.trackEvent('Newsletter Signup');" class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 mt-8 lg:mt-10"> <div class=""> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-500"> &copy; 2024 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
