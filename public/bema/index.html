You need to be awesome at understanding and use data, talking to users, stakeholders, presenting for larger groups, running workshops, evangelizing, building a team and a lot lot more.</p> <p>You can never expect a new product manager to be awesome in all areas, heck I don't even think you can expect a product manager with years of experience to excel in all areas of product management.</p> <p>So what do you do when you as a leader of product managers have to help them develop? How do you and the product manager keep track of what areas they need to improve?</p> <p>At Trustpilot we have been running a program for our developers that we call BEMA - Be Even More Awesome. It's basically a conversation starter managers use to have a constructive conversation with their reports about what we as a company expect their skillset to be, how the employee sees them in this mix and from there the manager and employee will have a constructive conversation about the team members skills and how the employee can develop to Become Even More Awesome.</p> <p>Together the manager and the employee select one area that the employee will focus on for the next quarter. This focus area could be something like "Data Knowledge", a fairly broad area. From there its the employee's responsibility to work on getting better data knowledge, but you as a manager needs to support.</p> <p>In your biweekly 1:1's you should talk about progress, talk about exercise the employee can do, what she chooses to do with her 20% time that helps her get better. Doing the week you should share articles and talk with her about the theme. Even sit down with her and help her out with her 20% projects or places where she is applying the skill to her daily work.</p> <p>The tool has worked super well for the six months I have been using it. It has been an awesome conversation starter and my team members have already developed a lot within the selected areas. It has even opened my eyes for areas where my team have different views of their skills, both better or worse, then my view on them, this has helped me guide them a lot better.</p> <p>You can find our <a href="/images/bema.pdf">BEMA paper here</a>, so go and test it out and become an even more awesome manager yourself!</p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 lg:py-16 lg:px-8"> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 xl:flex xl:items-center"> <div class="xl:w-0 xl:flex-1"> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class="mt-8 sm:w-full sm:max-w-md xl:mt-0 xl:ml-8"> <form class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 lg:mt-10"> <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 md:flex md:items-center md:justify-between lg:px-8"> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-500"> &copy; 2023 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
