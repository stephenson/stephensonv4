In my experience, it’s way more dangerous when founders don’t work on expressing and fixing their leadership style.</p> <p>You end up in a wasteland between the two modes where the founder is unhappy, frustrated and hates what their job turned out to be. You have a team of hired professional managers who end up frustrated and without authentic leadership from the founder, they need, but it does not stop there; it’s a wasteland that you will drag the entire organisation into. This feels like micromanagement, constantly changing directions and resulting in a loss of trust in the founder and the leadership.</p> <p>Manager Mode can work, and Founder Mode can be amazing, but the middle ground will kill your company.</p> <h2 id=be-mindful-of-your-leadership-style>Be mindful of your leadership style</h2> <p>So, dear founders, you need to actively work on discovering your leadership style. It does not need to be anything written in a book; it can be something you invent in the same way you are inventing your product. However, fairly early in your scaling journey, you need to be able to express what your leadership style is to ensure alignment with the leaders you bring on.</p> <p>I do not think anybody at Apple was in doubt about how Steve Jobs led, but in almost all companies I have worked at as a hired gun, people have been in doubt about the founders’ leadership style, involvement, and expectations. I have seen founders approve new features with little feedback, only to delete all the code and rebuild the feature over the weekend, damaging the team’s confidence when they return Monday to see their work gone. This action destroyed all opportunities to provide candid feedback that could have raised the bar for the entire team, which led to a lot of trust loss that week.</p> <p>I have also seen founders who lost the ability to make decisions after hiring a top-notch leadership team. They became too distant from the front-line staff and customers, causing the entire company to become a gridlock.</p> <p>I agree that founders should use the superpowers hidden in how they can lead, but it all stands on being mindful and aware of their leadership style. I also (very subjectively here) think that former founders are often the best leaders (and PMs) you can hire in the scaling stage. We know what it is to be a founder, and we know how to lead as founders in our teams.</p> <p>If you are unsure how to define or even discover your leadership style, I encourage you to seek wisdom from a leadership coach. I have both seen others and grown immensely myself from working with someone a ton more knowledgeable than myself. The truth is also that I have not been aware of my leadership style (and lack of it) while being in the trenches of startup life; I have only had the ability to discover that while working as a hired manager.</p> <p>After reflecting on Founder Mode, it’s time for me to figure out what that means for my day-to-day management style in my current role, where I report to the founders but am a hired gun. Hopefully, more on that later.</p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class=""> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 "> <div class=""> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl mt-0"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class=mt-8> <form onsubmit="fathom.trackEvent('Newsletter Signup');" class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 mt-8 lg:mt-10"> <div class=""> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-500"> &copy; 2024 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> </body> </html>
