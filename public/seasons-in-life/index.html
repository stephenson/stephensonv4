"What is your commitment? Are you not just going to leave us in a few months to go and start a new company???".</p> <p>I understand where that worry comes from; there are some fundamental truths to it; when you founded a company once, I believe there is a more significant likelihood for you to do it again, but there are a few very important things missing in that argument:</p> <h2 id=taking-a-brake>Taking a brake</h2> <p>Starting a startup is tough; sometimes, we need a break from the level of responsibilities. This does not mean that former founders want to slack off and not take any responsibility, but as a founder, you have a unique level of commitment compared to a hired senior manager at the same level. The stress of having your future wealth tied up in a company and letting other people take decisions that could negatively impact your own personal wealth is fucking stressful. Feelings of responsibility towards the entire staff, customers and investors. Doubt in yourself because because you always have to do things you have never tried and therefore suck at.</p> <p>It's fucking stressful, and taking a job for a period to "relax" is not slacking off at work; it's relaxing compared to the accumulated stresses of being a founder.</p> <p>In my experience, you get employees with higher impact when you hire a "relaxing " founder than a non-founder in high gear.</p> <h2 id=commitment>Commitment</h2> <p>"But are you not going to leave tomorrow to start a startup"? Fuck no, if I wanted to do that, I did it yesterday. Yes, maybe one day down the road I am going to leave just like any other of your employees (there are shockingly low average tenues in our industry), and yes, maybe the reason I am leaving will be different, but nobody I know commits to a job to make salary for a few months, then we founders know better and just find a freelance gig or a product we can sell. Instead of worrying about when a former founder will leave, try to understand why they are even looking for a job right now and see if you can give them what they are looking for in an extended period.</p> <h2 id=seasons-in-life>Seasons in life</h2> <p>Startup life is demanding and equally rewarding, but sometimes, it is not the right time in your life. I have two small kids, one of them sleeps like shit, and it's a full-time side gig to run a loving family without the household turning into a dumpster. I am in a season in my life right where I want time with family, I want time to sail, I want time with my lovely wife, and I still want a challenging job, but not a job where I have to take on a whole mental load of a founder. The season in my life is not to start something right now, but a new season begins one day.</p> <p>So, should you hire founders? YES! You will get resourced individuals with a lot of experience who have tried to solve many problems that an ordinary worker has never been exposed to, let alone tried to solve. You will get someone who will automatically work in "<a href="/founder-mode/">founder mode</a>" even inside someone else org. You will also get someone who will challenge you and speak up, which is not bad! Founders as PMs are even more magical than in many other roles.</p> <p>The best founders to hire are those who have made an exit and don't need to work but choose to do so because they can't stop themselves; they can be true superpowers!</p> <p>Founders are some of the most committed people I know, so if you fear that commitment, consider what level of commitment it takes to start a company. Is that bigger than taking a job? Hell yes. Is the commitments different between a former founder and a non-founder when taking a job? No.</p> <p>Founders, should you take a job instead of starting a company? Not if you genuinely feel that there is a burning amount of energy inside you to build a company right now, but the fastest way to 10k MRR is to get on the payroll.</p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class=""> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 "> <div class=""> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl mt-0"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class=mt-8> <form onsubmit="fathom.trackEvent('Newsletter Signup');" class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 mt-8 lg:mt-10"> <div class=""> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-500 hover:text-gray-600"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-500"> &copy; 2025 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ogkit@1"></script> </body> </html>
