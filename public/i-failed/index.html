I quit that startup and traveled back to Copenhagen to pick up with my now profitable SaaS company and make it into a unicorn.</p> <p>I am flying, I am going to make a dent in the universe!</p> <p>I can't walk into a theater without imagining myself on stage as the Steve Jobs of business software standing there to introduce "the next big thing" to the cheers of fans.</p> <p><img alt="" class=img-fluid src="/images/steve-0f6c4c1a.jpg"/></p> <p>What a crazy year, everybody from the Sandhill road investors to my mom has told how fantastic I was â€“ I was flying.</p> <p>Not only did I see myself on stage as the next generation Steve Jobs, I also thought I was him when it came to designing and building our products.</p> <p>Steve was a once-in-a-lifetime product designer, he was always right, I am not.</p> <h2 id=talking-to-customers-only-listening-to-myself>Talking to customers, only listening to myself.</h2> <p>We did what all the startup blogs tell you to do - went to speak with customers about our product. I read Rocket Surgery Made Easy and thought I was ready for confirmation of how brilliant my new product idea was.</p> <p>Oh boy, I am damn good at manipulating people</p> <p>every time I interviewed a customer and they started to criticize a new feature, I would dump everything I have read about doing UX studies and discovery and go full-on sales mode. I would walk out of the meeting feeling like Steve Jobs because I just got the customer to say that my idea was awesome.</p> <p>I, again and again, confirmed my own assumptions, not by doing discovery, but by persuading myself that the feature was awesome after manipulating our customer's needs.</p> <p>Had I known what I know today I would not have talked the team into building 70% of what we build. Imagine what six years of great discovery would have resulted in, maybe a gold mine of fantastic products that would have propelled the company to even greater success than it had when I left. Oh, how I failed!</p> <p>You need to leave your pride at the door when you do discovery - it's hard as a founder, designer, and proud worker, but if you don't do it, you will be the main source of your company's failures.</p> <p>Doing great. Over the last two years at Trustpilot, I have been allowed to focus on product management and develop my skills, and boy have I changed. Today I would approach my old job in a different way, but the good thing is that I know what to do in the future and that the company is still around today and doing great. Firmafon has 30+ employees, running profitably, with super happy customers and employees, and my old co-founders are still enjoying running it!</p> <p>Harry, who took ownership of the product after I left, has succeeded in changing the culture so that they can actually listen to clients - hell, I even help him out with a few tricks now and then.</p> </article> <div class="lg:mt-12"> <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-12 sm:px-6 lg:py-16 lg:px-8"> <div class="px-6 py-6 bg-indigo-700 rounded-lg md:py-12 md:px-12 lg:py-16 lg:px-16 xl:flex xl:items-center"> <div class="xl:w-0 xl:flex-1"> <h2 class="text-2xl font-extrabold tracking-tight text-white sm:text-3xl"> Was that mildly interesting? </h2> <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg leading-6 text-indigo-200"> Sign up for my newsletter, and don't lose out when I write new blog posts on product management and leadership! </p> </div> <div class="mt-8 sm:w-full sm:max-w-md xl:mt-0 xl:ml-8"> <form class="sm:flex" name=subscriber action="https://stephenson.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=33ec94a56a45e2e50f4244650&amp;id=1ddf384f90&amp;f_id=000348e0f0" method=post> <label for=email-address class=sr-only>Email address</label> <input id=email-address name=EMAIL type=email autocomplete=email required class="w-full border-white px-5 py-3 placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white rounded-md" placeholder="Enter your email"> <button type=submit class="mt-3 w-full flex items-center justify-center px-5 py-3 border border-transparent shadow text-base font-medium rounded-md text-white bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-indigo-700 focus:ring-white sm:mt-0 sm:ml-3 sm:w-auto sm:flex-shrink-0"> Subscribe </button> </form> <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-indigo-200"> I promise that I will not email you too often; you can trust me; I did spend a few years building a legal tech startup to solve email permissions! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-900 lg:mt-10"> <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-6 md:flex md:items-center md:justify-between lg:px-8"> <div class="flex justify-center space-x-6 md:order-2"> <a href="https://twitter.com/nikstep" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-500"> <span class=sr-only>Twitter</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden=true> <path d="M8.29 20.251c7.547 0 11.675-6.253 11.675-11.675 0-.178 0-.355-.012-.53A8.348 8.348 0 0022 5.92a8.19 8.19 0 01-2.357.646 4.118 4.118 0 001.804-2.27 8.224 8.224 0 01-2.605.996 4.107 4.107 0 00-6.993 3.743 11.65 11.65 0 01-8.457-4.287 4.106 4.106 0 001.27 5.477A4.072 4.072 0 012.8 9.713v.052a4.105 4.105 0 003.292 4.022 4.095 4.095 0 01-1.853.07 4.108 4.108 0 003.834 2.85A8.233 8.233 0 012 18.407a11.616 11.616 0 006.29 1.84"/> </svg> </a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklasstephenson/" class="text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-500"> <span class=sr-only>LinkedIn</span> <svg class="h-6 w-6" fill=currentColor enable-background="new 0 0 56.693 56.693" id=Layer_1 version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 56.693 56.693" width="56.693px" xml:space=preserve xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g><path d="M30.071,27.101v-0.077c-0.016,0.026-0.033,0.052-0.05,0.077H30.071z"/><path d="M49.265,4.667H7.145c-2.016,0-3.651,1.596-3.651,3.563v42.613c0,1.966,1.635,3.562,3.651,3.562h42.12 c2.019,0,3.654-1.597,3.654-3.562V8.23C52.919,6.262,51.283,4.667,49.265,4.667z M18.475,46.304h-7.465V23.845h7.465V46.304z M14.743,20.777h-0.05c-2.504,0-4.124-1.725-4.124-3.88c0-2.203,1.67-3.88,4.223-3.88c2.554,0,4.125,1.677,4.175,3.88 C18.967,19.052,17.345,20.777,14.743,20.777z M45.394,46.304h-7.465V34.286c0-3.018-1.08-5.078-3.781-5.078 c-2.062,0-3.29,1.389-3.831,2.731c-0.197,0.479-0.245,1.149-0.245,1.821v12.543h-7.465c0,0,0.098-20.354,0-22.459h7.465v3.179 c0.992-1.53,2.766-3.709,6.729-3.709c4.911,0,8.594,3.211,8.594,10.11V46.304z"/></g></svg> </a> </div> <div class="mt-8 md:mt-0 md:order-1"> <p class="text-center text-base text-gray-400"> &copy; 2023 Niklas Stephenson - You know all rights reserved and stuff. </p> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
