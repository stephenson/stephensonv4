Yesterday I talked to a candidate who was considering applying for a developer role at [Legal Monster](https://www.legalmonster.com)
, he could not understand why we did not apply ML/AI to solve problems.

ML/AI is great for some things, but a lot of things can be solved with simpler technology. We should as an industry always try to solve problems with the right tool for the right job and for me simplicity is an important factor in picking the right tool.

Way too many developers have "shiny new object syndrome". The tech stack rarely changes the value of a product, solving a customers problem do, and customers rarely care about how the problem is solved behind the scenes.

We have thousands of users on our platform, not a single one have chosen not to use us due to our stack, but some choose not to use us when we don't solve their problems.
