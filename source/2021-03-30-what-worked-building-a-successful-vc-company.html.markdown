For years I have raised money from venture capital funds to fund my businesses. Still, I have never spent a lot of time understand how a venture fund works, so I jumped on the opportunity to talk to [Peter Egehoved](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteregehoved/) from [Seed Capital](https://seedcapital.dk/). We talked about what made Seed Capital successful and what enabled them to raise their 4th fund. 

Entrepreneurs need to understand how VC companies work to raise money from them. We need to know what the VC funds investors (called LP - Limited Partners) expect from the VC and how the fund works to figure out if we can deliver on the build-in expectations to our startup from the fund.
