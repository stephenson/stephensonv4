I am thinking of starting a new podcast where I talk to successful entrepreneurs, not about their story, but about the small details that made their company work.

The podcast will be focused on software businesses, but after discovering that my coach has raised his prices to a whopping 1000$ an hour, I just had to talk with him about starting a super successful coaching business.

Hope you will share any feedback with me, this is a pre-pilot episode and the first time I am producing a podcast, time to learn! Hope you enjoy it.
